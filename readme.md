# Circles
Circles is a new style of social networking based on your interests on similartirs with the others!

## Project Description
Tihs app is for people who are interested in social networks, e.g. everyone.
It will let users join the app anonymously. After that, the users can choose
their interests, such as reading, hiking, or coding….. Based on each users’
preferences, the app automatically assigns them into the same friends
circle and people then can reveal their names and start chatting with each
other or see other people’s posts. If the user stays anonymous, he/she will still
be able to see other people’s posts relevant to their interests.
However, chatting or commenting will not be allowed.
The app will store data such as user information for accounts and passwords. The database also will stroe text/images to serve the purpose as a social networking web app. 
Users will be able to perform login/register actions. Users will also be able to browse other peoples' circles, e.g. posts and chats.
Given enough time, geo-location features could be an add-on feature to give users a better chance to make friends in their lovely neighbourhood.
However, if there is not enough time, the chatting feature may have to be postponed.
